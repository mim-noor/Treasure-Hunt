# Treasure-Hunt
The objective of this project is to design and implement a console-based
treasure hunt game in C, combining strategy, excitement, and challenges. The game features a
grid-based layout where the player navigates to uncover hidden treasures while avoiding traps.
To make the gameplay engaging and dynamic, elements such as moving traps, time limits, and
power-ups are introduced. These twists not only enhance the player experience but also test
their decision-making and problem-solving skills in real time. This project will provide hands-on
experience with essential programming concepts, such as arrays, dynamic memory allocation,
user input handling, and game logic development, making it an excellent exercise for learning
and applying C programming techniques.
